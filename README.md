Game of Life Simulator is a fast simulator of the Conway's (and not Conway) Game Of Life.
It's developed in C# using Windows Forms.

Features
 - All parameters can be changed in real-time, such as algorithm, randomization, size, color, maximum age, bounds type, etc.
 - Control the simulation (play, pause, step)
 - Record the current simulation or a randomized simulation to an AVI video file.
 - Drag & Drop to load patterns from _.cells_, _.rle_ or _.lif_ files. (Download [the collection](http://www.conwaylife.com/patterns/all.zip) from LifeWiki).
